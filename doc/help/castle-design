This storyline originate from Story 1, value 3-5, which 
takes place in a town named "Windy Knight" south of London, which
is preceeded by a manmade tunnel 600+ years ago.That tunnel is
300 meters long and in the middle, there stuck a mysterious
sword, which no one knows how or why its there. The town itself,
its surrouded by moutains from 3 directions, the only part thats 
not, it faces the deep ocean from south down the cliff.

The town itself, for its secrecy and unique geographical placement,
was used as a training ground of royal knights for his majesty 
in med-evil ages. In 1838, because of the its foretress likeness,
an underground jail was build. Since the town possess a natural
richness anthracites, prisoners were forced to build a railroad 
connect the town to London. The town's population is composed of
fishers and farmers mostly. If you sum that with prisoners, at 1888,
the town's population was 517. Then, on a normal night, the town's
people disappeared, all thats left, are the tourturous mid-evil age 
knight training facilities...

* The training facilities that contains in this town are numerous.
However, since we are lazy,and busy with SRWF, we will only construct
them one by one, and month by month :P
on the schedule are DualHeadedDragon's room, and 77 Rings. there maybe
is some more to come in the distant future, but dont bet on it.
** all the training regiments are designed to be a crossover of a 
mini game and rpg battle, only in LPMud.
